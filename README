Aquaria
------

This is my aquarium controller project.

I felt that the USB sensor components would be more generally useful,
and are in the 'usense' project now.

Compiling
---------

If you've checked this out from the repository, you will notice
that the 'configure' file is missing. Not a problem! Just run:

 $ ./autoconf.sh

That builds the 'configure' file, and all the automake and autoconf
support files. From there, just run:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
