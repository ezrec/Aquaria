# Range operators (everything but time) are as follows:
#   < MAX
#   > MIN
#   <= MAX
#   >= MIN
#   in MIN to MAX	(MIN < temp && temp < MAX)
#   from MIN to MAX	(MIN <= temp && temp <= MAX)
#   = VALUE
#   != VALUE
#
# Time operators are as follows:
#   at H1:M1 until H2:M2	(H1:M1 <= time && time <= H2:M2)
#   at H1:M1 for H2:M2		(H1:M1 <= time && time < (H1:M1 + H2:M2))
#   at H1:M1                    (H1:M1 <= time && time < (H1:M1 + 00:01))
#   or you can use ranges. The '=' and '!=' operators are not allowed.
#
# Weekday operator is as follows:
#   is <sunday|monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday>
#
#   or you can use ranges.
